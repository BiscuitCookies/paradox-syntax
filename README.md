# paradox-syntax README

This repository contains textmate grammars for Paradox Interactive games. Currently:

* A generic paradox grammar
* A Stellaris grammar

It will also contain some themes designed to work with these grammars.

## Todo

* Value blocks (e.g. `prerequisites = { "tech_5" })
* Numerical operators (`<,>`)
